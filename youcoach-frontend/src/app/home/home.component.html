        <p class="left-align light flow-text">You-Coach is an academic coaching program between students in
          secondary schools, supervised by the schools.</p>
        <p class="left-align light flow-text">
          Students with difficulties in a subject and who want to make progress can
          ask for explanations and advice to other students in their school who have mastered the subject
          or have already acquired a good working method.</p>
        <p class="left-align light flow-text">
          With You-Coach everything is quick and easy: just
          register as a Coach or request a coaching session on this website, and it will organize a private
          coaching session in the school.
