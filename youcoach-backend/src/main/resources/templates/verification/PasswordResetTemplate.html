    Hello, <span th:text="${fullName}">unknown profile</span>, you are receiving this email because you or someone else requested a password reset at
    YouCoach.
</p>
<p>
    If this action was taken by you, great!<br />
    <br />
    You can just <a th:href="@{${url}(token=${token})}" href="${hostName}">proceed with your password reset</a>.
    If a token hasn't been automatically inserted for you when you get there then please present the following one:<br /><br />
    <span th:text="${token}"></span>
</p>
<p>
    If this action wasn't taken by you: no panic. Your password is safe and unchanged. You may just ignore this message.
</p>
<p>
    The YouCoach team.
